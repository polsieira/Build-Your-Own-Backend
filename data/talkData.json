Drug-resistant bacteria known as superbugs killed nearly 700,000 people last year, and by 2050 that number could be 10 million -- more than cancer kills each year. Can physics help? In a talk from the frontiers of science, radiation scientist David Brenner shares his work studying a potentially life-saving weapon: a wavelength of ultraviolet light known as far-UVC, which can kill superbugs safely, without penetrating our skin. Followed by a Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson.","speakers":[{"name":"David Brenner","occupation":"Radiation scientist","introduction":"We are decidedly losing the war against superbugs, and with a projected annual death toll by 2050 of 10 million people.
